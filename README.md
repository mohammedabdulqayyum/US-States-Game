# US-States-Game
The project "US State Games Built in Python" is a beginner Python project that combines data analysis using pandas, GUI programming, and game logic. The project goal is to build an interactive game that quizzes a user on naming U.S. states.
The game works by loading a CSV dataset of U.S. states data, extracting state names and positions, displaying a blank US map image, and allowing the user to guess states by clicking on the map. The game tracks correct guesses in a list and shows the state name on the map when it is guessed. The user wins the game by guessing all of the states. If the user needs help, they can click on a hint button to reveal the name of a random state.

To build the game, the project uses the following Python libraries:

pandas: For data analysis and manipulation
tkinter: For GUI programming
random: For generating random numbers
The project is divided into the following steps:

Load the CSV dataset: The project uses the pandas library to load the CSV dataset of U.S. states data. The dataset contains the state names, abbreviations, and capitals.
Extract state names and positions: The project uses the pandas library to extract the state names and positions from the dataset.
Display a blank US map image: The project uses the tkinter library to display a blank US map image.
Allow guessing state by clicking position: The project uses the tkinter library to allow the user to guess states by clicking on the map.
Track correct guesses in a list: The project uses a Python list to track correct guesses.
Show state name on map when guessed: The project uses the tkinter library to show the state name on the map when it is guessed.
Allow guessing all states to win: The project allows the user to win the game by guessing all of the states.
Save unguessed states to new CSV: If the user does not guess all of the states, the project saves the unguessed states to a new CSV file.
The project is a good introduction to Python programming and can be used to learn about the following concepts:

Data analysis using pandas
GUI programming using tkinter
Game logic
Object-oriented programming
The project can be extended to add new features, such as:

Multiple difficulty levels
A timer
A leaderboard
The ability to guess states by typing their names
Overall, the project "US State Games Built in Python" is a well-designed and informative project that can be used to learn about Python programming and US state geography.
